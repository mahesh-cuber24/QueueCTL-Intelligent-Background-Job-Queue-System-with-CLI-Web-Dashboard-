# 🚀 QueueCTL — Intelligent Background Job Queue System (with CLI + Web Dashboard)

QueueCTL is a **TypeScript-based background job management system** with real-time CLI controls and a modern web dashboard for monitoring and retrying failed jobs.

## 📋 Overview

QueueCTL lets you schedule, execute, and manage background jobs efficiently. It supports:
- Real-time job processing with retries and exponential backoff
- Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed jobs
- Persistent storage (SQLite)
- Configurable retry/backoff parameters
- Interactive **Web Dashboard** for visualization and control

## 🧠 Architecture

### 🧭 Data Flow

```text
User → CLI → Queue DB → Worker(s) → DLQ (if fails) → Dashboard (monitor)
```

### 🧩 Core Modules

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `db/` | SQLite database management |
| `cli/` | Command-line interface logic |
| `core/` | Job processing & retry logic |
| `server.ts` | Express-based web dashboard |
| `dist/` | Compiled TypeScript output |

---

## 🧰 CLI Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| `enqueue` | Add new job to queue | `node dist/cli/index.js enqueue job1 "echo Hello"` |
| `worker start --count <n>` | Start N workers | `node dist/cli/index.js worker start --count 2` |
| `status` | View job summary | `node dist/cli/index.js status` |
| `list --state <state>` | List jobs by state | `node dist/cli/index.js list --state failed` |
| `dlq list` | Show DLQ jobs | `node dist/cli/index.js dlq list` |
| `dlq retry <id>` | Retry a DLQ job | `node dist/cli/index.js dlq retry jobX` |
| `config get` | View config values | `node dist/cli/index.js config get` |
| `config set <key> <value>` | Update config | `node dist/cli/index.js config set max_retries 3` |

### 💻 **Access**

Once the server is running:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

- `/` → Main Dashboard  
- `/dlq` → Dead Letter Queue Viewer  
- `/config` → Config Values Page

---

### 🧠 **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** HTML5 + CSS3 (custom responsive design)
- **Backend:** Express.js + Better-SQLite3
- **Runtime:** Node.js (TypeScript compiled to ES modules)
- **Database:** SQLite (Persistent local queue + config store)
